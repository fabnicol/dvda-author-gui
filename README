INSTALL instructions

under windows, run the installer. 

Under linux or Mac OSX, run sudo tar xpJvf *.tar.xz && sudo chown $USER dvdc-author-package

Building
———————-

To build the GUI use the Qt5 project (*.pro) preferably using a static build of Qt5. 
The project only uses Qtbase.

Linux note
----------
On Debian linux at least, if you want to compile cdrecord from fresh Jorg Schilling source code, use a recent package 
(version a57 was tested to build) and build with Gmake.linux (root-) copied to/usr/bin.

Options usage
-------------

If you want to burn a disc with cdrecord, first check the "Burn disc with cdrecord" then enter a path in the line edit.
It will be kept in memory until changed.
If this does not work you can also enter a SCSI bus code, like: 0,0,0
To know which kind of path/bus code you should enter, open a command line window and type cdrecord -devices and cdrecord -scanbus
if this fails.
On Ubuntu, cdrecord -devices yields the following output:

cdrecord -devices
wodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :
